## Testing Plan

Implement the z-score equation we wrote in the python script and hook it up with population 1\~3 and additional 2 cases. Have it print out the result and insert them into excel. In excel make an error row that checks and outputs a boolean value on whether the result of the python script and excel equation is the same.
